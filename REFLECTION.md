## Can I explain what my code does?
Yes, I can explain all of my CSS and the purpose it served in making the website look more presentable.

## What was my coding process?
Overall I went from top to bottom doing some rough styling for each of my sections, and once I had a rough outline I went through and refined it, adding shadows, styling the background to utilize the blank space in the back on higher resolutions, and lowered the opacity on my sections so that lower resolutions would also benefit from the gradient background

## What challenges did I have?
I found flex extremely confusing at first and couldn't even utilize it properly. I did find a use for it in my header, and could very easily see its potential in other portions of the website, but I believe the other sections just didn't call for it. I did also spend a lot of time messing around with flex overall in ways that didn't make it to the final product so I could build experience with it and more effectively utilize it in the future.

## What would I do differently now?
Knowing what I know about flex now, I would probably have completely changed the architecture of the website using flex. In my little experimentation phase I found it really fun to mess around with and in hindsight would have loved to build an entirely different format using flex, both for my own enjoyment and so I could demonstrate my understanding of it.
